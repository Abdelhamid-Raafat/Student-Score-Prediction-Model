# Student Performance Prediction

##  Project Overview
This project builds a predictive model to estimate students' exam scores based on study hours.  
The dataset is from Kaggle: *Student Performance Factors*.  

## Steps Followed
1. **Data Cleaning** – handled missing values and ensured correct data types.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – created visualizations to understand relationships.  
3. **Data Splitting** – divided into training and testing sets.  
4. **Model Training** – applied **Linear Regression** to predict exam scores.  
5. **Evaluation** – measured performance using metrics such as R², RMSE, and MAE.  
6. **Visualization** – plotted predicted vs. actual exam scores.  

## Results
- Achieved strong correlation between study hours and exam scores.  
- Linear regression provided interpretable insights into performance factors.
